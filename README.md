## Introduction：
The Trestle underwater acoustic signal dataset was collected on August 13, 2020, in the shallow coastal area of the Trestle scenic spot in the Shinan District, Qingdao City, Shandong Province, China. 

Modulation types：
OFDM, 2PSK, 4PSK, 2FSK, 4FSK, 16QAM, 64QAM

Sample size:	
200 signals for each type of modulation, 1400 signals in total.

Carrier frequency:
14000Hz

Symbol rate:
560sps

You can use "signal_preproc.m" to preprocess the dataset!
